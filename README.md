# Irrigation-Dashboard
Irrigation Dashboard using Tkinter, Matplotlib, NumPy SQLite  
  
Course Project: Created a GUI application written in Python to provide an Irrigation Dashboard. Users are presented with
visualised data of soil moisture across different regions of a farm in the form of a heat-map and are alerted if
moisture levels recorded are out of user-defined range. They can also monitor the amount of water consumed for
irrigation for assessments. The heat-map is generated using Matplotlib along with NumPy. SQLite and TKinter are
used for database and GUI respectively.
